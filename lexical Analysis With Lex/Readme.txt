It is a tool or software which automatically generates a lexical analyzer (finite Automata). 
It takes as its input a LEX source program and produces lexical Analyzer as its output. 
Lexical Analyzer will convert the input string entered by the user into tokens as its output.
LEX is a program generator designed for lexical processing of character input/output stream. 
Anything from simple text search program that looks for pattern in its input-output file to a C compiler that transforms a program into optimized code.

In program with structure input-output two tasks occurs over and over. 
It can divide the input-output into meaningful units and then discovering the relationships among the units for C program (the units are variable names, constants, and strings). 
This division into units (called tokens) is known as lexical analyzer or LEXING. 
LEX helps by taking a set of descriptions of possible tokens n producing a routine called a lexical analyzer or LEXER or Scanner.
